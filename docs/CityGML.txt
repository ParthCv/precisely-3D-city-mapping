CityGML

The CityGML City Geographic Markup Language, standard defines a conceptual model and exchange format for the
representation, storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models. GML schema is also an XML-based format for the
representation of virtual 3D models. It is implemented as an application schema of GML3. CityGML takes advantage of
other open standards and its development has proceeded in careful cooperation with other groups. Development of
CityGML began in 2002 by the members of the Special Interest Group 3D (SIG 3D) of the Geodata Infrastructure
North-Rhine Westphalia (GDI NRW) initiative in Germany.

CityGML represents the graphic appearance of city models and also the semantic or thematic properties, taxonomies and
aggregations of digital terrain models, sites (including buildings, bridges and tunnels), vegetation, water bodies,
transportation facilities, etc. The underlying model differentiates five consecutive levels of detail (LoD), where
objects become more detailed with increasing LoD, both in geometry and thematic differentiation. CityGML is the result
of a well-organized effort to bring together related standards through careful coordination with various standards
groups and user groups.
